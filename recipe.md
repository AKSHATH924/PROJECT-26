1) Take milk into the blender or grinder.

2) Add vanilla extract.

3) Also add ice cream and sugar (if using). I have not added any extra sugar. Sweetness from the ice cream was enough for me.

4) Blend it till it is smooth. Do not over blend it otherwise ice cream will start to melt and you will get thin milkshake.

To get the thick milkshake, do not over blend it. Otherwise ice cream will start to melt and you will end up with thin milkshake. Blend it just until everything is smooth.
You can adjust the amount of milk and ice cream as per your preference. If you like extra thick milkshake then increase the amount of ice cream. If you prefer thin milkshake then decrease the amount of ice cream and add little more milk. In short, adapt it as per your preference.
The above given measurements will give you medium thick consistency.


Add few nuts in it while blending e.g. almonds, cashews, walnuts, pecans. My favorite combinations is vanilla milkshake with almonds and pecans. Try it once, you will also like it.
Add few canned cherries or maraschino cherries for cherry vanilla milkshake.
You can add a tablespoon of chocolate chips while blending.
I have already shared one variation - oreo milkshake.
Go with your imagination and enjoy different flavors each and every time.

Enjoy this milkshake whenever you are craving for it. It will be a treat for kids. During the summer season, I like to have it in the afternoon.
